        <p style="font-family:monospace;"> Mount Si: To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day.

        <p style="font-family: cursive;"> Crater Falls: A relatively flat, easy-to-follow trail through old growth forest can be good for families or out-of-town guests, with cascades along the way for easy turn-around spots.Find the trailhead to the right; you want the path that heads east on the Wonderland.

There is no repose like that of the green deep woods. Here grow the wallflower and the violet. The squirrel will come and sit upon your knee, the logcock will wake you in the morning. Sleep in forgetfulness of all ill. Of all the upness accessible to mortals, there is no upness comparable to the mountains"
